            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With over 14 years of experience as an Executive Sales Engineer at Schneider Electric, I specialize in delivering innovative energy management and automation solutions to clients in the Tulsa, OK area. My role involves working closely with customers across diverse industries—such as healthcare, oil and gas, water/wastewater, and casinos—to assess their unique needs, develop customized proposals, and implement solutions that enhance operational efficiency and promote sustainability. I take pride in providing scalable, reliable systems that meet both immediate and long-term goals. My expertise spans technical sales, client relationship management, and project execution, ensuring that every solution aligns with the client’s vision while maintaining the highest standards of quality and performance. Beyond the technical aspects, I am deeply committed to fostering lasting partnerships, often building trust through meaningful conversations on the golf course or during in-depth strategy sessions. My approach combines technical proficiency with a client-centric mindset, allowing me to deliver impactful results that drive progress and innovation in energy management.
